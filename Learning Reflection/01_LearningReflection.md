> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Testing the Webapp was a good learning experience. It helped me understand how to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I wrote the test cases by systematically breaking down the application's functionalities into smaller tasks, documenting each step, and specifying expected outcomes. My approach ensured clarity and comprehensiveness in the test cases, facilitating effective testing of the web application.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It’s user-friendly and has great features for editing and managing files.



     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- Not that many problems. Only had difficulties in understanding the basics still but I think after all i got it under control.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-I didn’t have much trouble with GitHub. I’ve used it before for other projects.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I would use Selenium with Python for automation because Selenium is widely used for web testing, and Python is easy to write and understand. Alternatively, Robot Framework could be a good option due to its simplicity in writing test cases.




## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- The most in-demand skills include:
Experience with automated testing tools like Selenium
Knowledge of software development and agile methodologies
Proficiency in scripting languages such as Python and JavaScript
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
Attention to detail
Good communication and teamwork abilities



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- Technical Skills: Advanced knowledge of automated testing frameworks, proficiency in multiple programming languages, experience with performance and security testing, familiarity with DevOps practices.

- Soft Skills: Improved communication, better teamwork, strong time management, continuous learning attitude.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- This project helped me put theoretical knowledge into practice. Writing test cases, finding bugs, and reporting them gave me a better understanding of software testing. The structured approach emphasized the importance of documentation and clear communication. The project was valuable for my learning, and I appreciated the practical application. I found the content quality good, and I suggest including more real-world examples in future assignments to enhance practical learning.
